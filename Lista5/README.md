# List 5 - Arrays and Strings
This list has 17 exercises, which we're basically coding with arrays and strings, besides functions, conditions and other things we have seen in the former lists.
All exercises are made by me and i hope they can be useful for your understanding in programming. All tips and advises are wellcome!

## Exercises Division
1. Create an array with length 20 and ask the user for its values. Thereafter, check how many odd and even numbers are in the array.
2. Create an array with length 20 and ask the user for its values. Thereafter, calculate its average and print the numbers below average. If the user insert a negative number, the program won't continue and will keep asking for a positive one.
3. Create two arrays with length 10 and ask the user for its values. Then, create a new one that is the multiplication of the numbers with same index.
4. Create an array with length 20 and ask the user for its values. Then, check which are the greatest and lesser numbers and print them with their indexes.
5. Create an array with length 20 and ask the user for its values. Then, switch its values; the first will be the last, the second will be the penultimate, etc.
6. Create an array with a length and values given by the user. Thereafter, change brutally some values and print the new array.
7. Create three array with length 10: two of them will be grades and the third will be the average of them. The program will print both grades and average of each student.
8. Create a program that will ask the enrollment number and salary of an employee. Then, it will calculates the percentage of increase based in if the enrollment number is odd or even; Thereafter, the program will print the enrollment number, salary, percentage of increase and new salary of each employee.
9. Create a program that checks if a character is in a string and gives its position of occurrence.
10. Create a program that checks if a string is a palindrome.
11. Create a program that checks if a sentence is a palindrome.
12. Create a program that copies a sentence.
13. Create a program that removes spaces from a sentence.
14. Create a program that counts how many vowels have in a sentence.
15. Create a program that inserts a character in a string/sentence in a position given by the user and print the new string/sentence.
16. Create a program that changes the vowels in a string/sentence for the letter "p".
17. Create a program that inserts the character "p" before the vowels of a string/sentence given by the user.

## Final Considerations
You'll mostly use the <string.h> library, besides of course <stdio.h>. However, <ctype.h> was very useful to check if a string is uppercase or lowercase, so i recommend it as well.
