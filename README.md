Salutations, stranger!
In this repository, I'm going to post some exercises I've done for my classes in C. 
They are just a simple introduction to the language, so it's going to be very useful for those who are starting. :)

## References
All codes are from my CSI101 - Computer Programming I classes from Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto (UFOP).
They are made by me, but the exercises are from my professor Fernando Bernardes de Oliveiras, `@fboliveira` on GitHub!

Best regards!
Bela
