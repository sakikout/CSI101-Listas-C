# CSI101-Listas-C
In this repository, I'm going to post some exercises I've done for my classes in C. They are just a simple introduction to the language, so it's going to be very useful for those who are starting with C. :)

Summing it up, the exercises are:
1. Choose a number and then make the program give its successor and predecessor;
2. Choose two numbers and make the program shows the four operations (sum, subtraction, division and multiplication);
3. Make a program that calculates the tip of a order in a restaurant, giving the total spent with food, the tip's value and the total w/ tip;
4. Make a program that calculates how many minimum wages someone receive;
5. Make a program that gives 9% off on a product;
6. Make a program that gives two values (A and B) and then switch their values;
7. Make a program that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit;
8. Make a program that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius;
9. Make a program that calculates the simple interest and the final amount;
10. Make a program that calculates how many minutes have passed since the beginning of the day.

Have some fun!
