# About
Salutations, stranger!
In this repository, I'm going to post some exercises I've done for my classes in C. 
They are just a simple introduction to the language, so it's going to be very useful for those who are starting. :)


## Content
All exercise lists have a specific theme to exercise. By the time, here they are:
- **Lista 1:** Variables, Constants, Expressions, Atribuitions, Data types, Data input and output;
- **Lista 2:** Expressions and Condicional Comands;
- **Lista 3:** Repetition Comands;
- **Lista 4:** Functions;
- **Lista 5:** Arrays and Strings;

## Observations:
Most exercises are in Portuguese, with just a few terms in English. I intend to pass them definetely to English soon!

## References
All codes are from my CSI101 - Computer Programming I classes from Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto (UFOP).
They are made by me, but the exercises are from my professor Fernando Bernardes de Oliveiras, [`@fboliveira`](https://github.com/fboliveira) on GitHub!

Best regards!<br>Bela
